# Server Info
## Client side mods required:
[fabric api](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)
[voice chat](https://modrinth.com/plugin/simple-voice-chat)
information may be inaccurate. for more details and an installation guide check Moose's doc (pinned in tg)

## Gamerules
keepInventory = True
(carpet) optimizedFastEntityMovement = True

## Shopping/trading district:
**a no grief and no pvp zone** where items can be traded simply through chests (shop mod will not be used)
rules of the district are stated in the rules section

## Recording - General
I will record the server from my perspective and it will also be recorded with flashback (mod) server side for the following players:
- me
- lizaO

the gc chat/calls wont be recorded. (calls can be if everyone agrees that a specific call should be but by default its a no).

the final video will then be posted on youtube. the goal is to tell some sort of story through what has happened over whatever time it will be before i start editing (probably will be at least 2 weeks)

## Recording - Specific Players
**Katya** doesn't want her identity to be revealed in the final video so her name and skin will be obscured by a mod in the final video (her nickname and skin will be normal to everyone while playing) so refer to her as "the one with no name" or something like that, doesn't really matter as long as it isn't katya. maybe she could get a name because of some lore.

## Rules
> **don't use cheats**. an example is x-ray but things like using flashback or replay mod to record **and then use it like freecam** are also considered cheating. **schematics mods and map mods are also considered cheating.** 

> griefing or stealing **is** allowed **if** at least 1 member of that team is currently online. otherwise it isn't

> don't use anyones real name in recorded text/audio, use their in-game name

> you cannot go to the trading district to escape a pvp fight

> you can not steal items from other people's shops
